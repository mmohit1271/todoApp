To-Do App
This is a simple To-Do application built using Node.js and Express, containerized using Docker, and deployed with Jenkins. The app allows users to view and manage tasks in a simple list format.

Features
Displays a list of tasks (Learn Docker, Build ToDo app).
Built with Node.js and Express.
Containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
Jenkins pipeline to automate the build and deployment process.
Prerequisites
Before you can run this application, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker
Docker Compose
Jenkins, if you want to use the Jenkins pipeline for CI/CD.
Project Structure
bash
Copy code
/todo-app
    /app
        index.js
        package.json
    Dockerfile
    docker-compose.yml
    Jenkinsfile
/app: Contains the app's source code, including index.js (the main entry point) and package.json (for managing dependencies).
Dockerfile: The file used to build a Docker image for the app.
docker-compose.yml: A configuration file for Docker Compose, making it easier to run the app with Docker.
Jenkinsfile: A file used to define a Jenkins pipeline that automates the build and deployment of the app.
How to Run the App Locally
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
2. Build the Docker Image
You can build the Docker image using the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t todo-app:latest .
3. Run the App with Docker Compose
If you want to quickly run the app in a container using Docker Compose, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
This will:

Build the Docker image (if not already built).
Start the app container in detached mode.
Map port 3000 on the container to port 3000 on your machine.
4. Access the App
Open your browser and go to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
You should see the To-Do app running.

Using the Jenkins Pipeline
The project also includes a Jenkins pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.

Prerequisites for Jenkins:
Install Docker on the Jenkins server.
Create Docker Hub credentials in Jenkins (for authentication to Docker Hub).
Install the Docker Pipeline plugin in Jenkins.
1. Set Up Jenkins Pipeline
Create a new Pipeline job in Jenkins.
Point Jenkins to your GitHub repository containing the code and the Jenkinsfile.
In Jenkins, configure the Docker Hub credentials and make sure they are added in the DOCKER_HUB_CREDS variable in the Jenkinsfile.
2. Trigger the Pipeline
After setting up the job, trigger the Jenkins pipeline:

Jenkins will:
Pull the code from the GitHub repository.
Build the Docker image.
Push the image to Docker Hub.
Deploy the app using Docker Compose.
How to Customize the App
If you want to add new tasks to the app, you can modify the todos array in index.js:

javascript
Copy code
let todos = [
    { id: 1, task: 'Learn Docker' },
    { id: 2, task: 'Build ToDo app' },
    // Add your new tasks here
];
You can also modify the HTML to add a front-end to interact with the app.

Troubleshooting
Port Conflicts: If the app is not running, make sure port 3000 is available on your host machine. You can change the exposed port in the docker-compose.yml file if needed.

Docker Issues: If you're facing issues with Docker, check the Docker logs for more information:

bash
Copy code
docker logs todo-app
